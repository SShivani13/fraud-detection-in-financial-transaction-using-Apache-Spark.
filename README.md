**Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions**

**Overview**

This project aims to develop an AI-based fraud detection system for financial transactions, particularly credit card transactions. The solution leverages Apache Spark, Databricks, and AWS S3 to process large-scale transaction data and detect fraudulent activities in real time. The data used for the project is sourced from Kaggle.

**Features**

Real-time fraud detection in financial transaction using Apache Spark.
Scalable and distributed data processing with Apache Spark.
Data storage and retrieval using AWS S3.
Anomaly detection with unsupervised learning techniques.
Alerts and notifications for potential fraudulent transactions.
Technologies Used
Apache Spark: Distributed data processing and machine learning.
Databricks: Collaborative platform for building and deploying ML workflows.
AWS S3: Cloud storage for storing and retrieving transaction data.
Kaggle: Source of the dataset for credit card transactions.
PySpark: Python API for Apache Spark for data processing and machine learning.
Architecture

**Data Collection:**

Kaggle's credit card transactions dataset was used as the source data.
Data was uploaded to AWS S3 for scalable cloud storage.
Data Preprocessing:

Data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering were performed on Databricks using PySpark.
Model Development:

Machine learning models were trained and evaluated in Databricks.
Both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques were employed.
Real-Time Processing:

Apache Spark Streaming was used to process incoming transaction data in real time.
Fraudulent transactions were flagged immediately.
Deployment:

The trained models were integrated into a production pipeline for real-time fraud detection.
Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle’s Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.

Dataset Description:

Contains anonymized credit card transactions from European cardholders.
Total records: ~285,000.
Imbalance: ~0.17% fraudulent transactions.
